# üî∑ Holocron

> *"The Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us; it binds the galaxy together."*
>
> Just as the ancient Jedi and Sith preserved their knowledge in holocrons, you too can safeguard your thoughts, tasks, and wisdom in this personal, encrypted repository of knowledge.

**Holocron** is a local-first, encrypted note-taking and task management application. Like the mystical devices of old, it requires no connection to the galaxy's network‚Äîyour knowledge remains yours alone, protected and private.

---

## üìñ First-Time Setup

### Prerequisites: Set Up Git Repository

**Before using Holocron**, you need to set up a Git repository for your notes:

```bash
# 1. Create or navigate to your notes folder
mkdir ~/my-holocron-notes
cd ~/my-holocron-notes

# 2. Initialize Git repository
git init

# 3. Configure Git user
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"

# 4. (Optional) Add remote repository for syncing across devices
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/my-notes.git

# 5. (Optional) Set up SSH keys for remote sync
# See GIT_SETUP.md for detailed Git configuration instructions
```

### Setup Wizard

When you first open Holocron, you'll be guided through the Setup Wizard:

#### Step 1: Select Repository Location

1. Click **"Select Folder"**
2. Navigate to your Git repository folder (created above)
3. Holocron will detect if it's a new or existing repository

#### Step 2: Create Passphrase (REQUIRED)

**Your passphrase is critical - there is NO recovery if lost!**

1. Enter a strong passphrase (minimum 8 characters recommended)
2. Confirm your passphrase
3. Click **"Create Repository"**

**How the passphrase works (Key Wrapping Architecture):**
- **At setup**: Generates a random 256-bit DEK (Data Encryption Key)
- **Wrapping**: Your passphrase derives a KEK (Key Encryption Key) that encrypts the DEK
- **Storage**: The wrapped DEK is stored in plaintext `config.json` (safe to commit!)
- **At unlock**: Your passphrase unwraps the DEK, which then encrypts/decrypts notes
- **Performance**: PBKDF2 runs once at unlock (not per-file) = 10-100x faster
- **Cross-device**: Same passphrase unwraps the same DEK on all your devices
- **No recovery**: Lost passphrase = lost DEK = cannot decrypt notes

**What gets encrypted:**
- ‚úÖ **Notes in Git**: `.md.enc` files (encrypted with DEK before commit)
- ‚úÖ **Kanban boards in Git**: `.json.enc` files (encrypted with DEK before commit)
- ‚úÖ **DEK itself**: Wrapped/encrypted with KEK (derived from your passphrase)

**What stays plaintext:**
- ‚úÖ **Local notes**: `.md` files on your disk (fast editing, no overhead)
- ‚úÖ **Config metadata**: `config.json` settings and wrapped DEK (not sensitive)

**Unlocking Existing Repository:**

If you're opening an existing Holocron repository:
1. Select the folder
2. Enter your existing passphrase
3. Click **"Unlock"** (passphrase unwraps the DEK from config.json)

#### Step 3: Configure Git Sync (Optional)

After setup, you can configure Git synchronization:
1. Click the Git icon in the header
2. Commit, push, and pull from the UI
3. (Optional) Enable auto-sync in Settings

See **[GIT_SETUP.md](./GIT_SETUP.md)** for comprehensive Git configuration instructions including SSH keys, remotes, and troubleshooting.

## üìÅ How File Storage Works

Understanding Holocron's two-layer architecture:

### On Your Local Filesystem

```
your-notes-folder/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .git/                          # Git repository (you create this)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .holocron/                     # Holocron metadata (auto-created)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json               # Plaintext config (v2.0 - NEW!)
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ encryption.salt        #   ‚îú‚îÄ Random salt for PBKDF2
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ encryption.wrappedDEK  #   ‚îú‚îÄ DEK encrypted with KEK
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ settings               #   ‚îî‚îÄ UI preferences (plaintext)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ notes/                         # PLAINTEXT notes for fast editing
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ YYYY/MM/DD/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ note-title.md         # ‚Üê Plaintext .md, ONLY on your machine
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kanban/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ board-name.json           # ‚Üê Plaintext .json, ONLY on your machine
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore                    # Optional (you create this)
```

**Key point**: Your notes are stored as regular plaintext `.md` files on your computer for fast, seamless editing with zero encryption overhead. The new `config.json` is also plaintext (v2.0) - it contains the wrapped DEK and settings, both safe to commit!

### In Your Git Repository

```
When you run 'git commit' and 'git push':

Git commits/remote contains:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .holocron/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json               # Safe to commit (plaintext metadata + wrapped DEK)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ notes/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ YYYY/MM/DD/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ note-title.md.enc     # ‚Üê AES-256-GCM encrypted with DEK
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kanban/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ board-name.json.enc       # ‚Üê AES-256-GCM encrypted with DEK
```

**Key point**: When you commit, Holocron automatically encrypts your plaintext `.md` files into `.md.enc` files using the DEK before they go into Git. Your plaintext notes **never leave your computer**. The `config.json` is committed as plaintext, but the DEK inside it is encrypted (wrapped) with your passphrase.

### The Encryption Flow (v2.0 - Key Wrapping)

**At repository setup (one time):**
```
User Passphrase
   ‚Üí PBKDF2 (300k iterations)
      ‚Üí KEK (Key Encryption Key)
         ‚Üí Wraps (encrypts) randomly-generated DEK
            ‚Üí Wrapped DEK stored in config.json
```

**At unlock (once per session):**
```
User Passphrase
   ‚Üí PBKDF2 (300k iterations)
      ‚Üí KEK (Key Encryption Key)
         ‚Üí Unwraps (decrypts) DEK from config.json
            ‚Üí DEK stored in memory (SecureString)
```

**When you commit (Save to Git):**
```
Local: note.md (plaintext)
   ‚Üí Encrypt with DEK (fast!)
      ‚Üí Git: note.md.enc (encrypted)
```

**When you pull (Load from Git):**
```
Git: note.md.enc (encrypted)
   ‚Üí Decrypt with DEK (fast!)
      ‚Üí Local: note.md (plaintext)
```

**When you edit (Daily use):**
```
Local: note.md (plaintext)
   ‚Üí No encryption, no overhead
      ‚Üí Instant, seamless editing
```

### Why This Design?

‚úÖ **Lightning fast** - 10-100x faster than v1.0 (PBKDF2 runs once, not per-file)
‚úÖ **Industry standard** - Same security model as 1Password and Bitwarden
‚úÖ **Fast editing** - Zero encryption overhead during daily use
‚úÖ **Secure sync** - Notes encrypted with DEK when syncing to Git
‚úÖ **Safe for public repos** - Even with public Git, notes cannot be decrypted without passphrase
‚úÖ **Simple config** - Config is plaintext (easier to read, modify, commit)
‚úÖ **Cross-device sync** - Same passphrase unwraps DEK on any machine
‚úÖ **No prompts** - DEK stored in memory after unlock (no repeated passphrase entry)

### Important Security Notes

- **Your plaintext `.md` files only exist on your computer** - they never get committed to Git
- **Only encrypted `.md.enc` files go into Git** - safe to push to GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.
- **Without your passphrase**, even if someone clones your Git repository, they cannot:
  - Unwrap the DEK from `config.json`
  - Decrypt any `.md.enc` files
  - Access any of your notes
- **The `config.json` is plaintext but secure**:
  - Contains wrapped (encrypted) DEK - useless without passphrase
  - Contains settings - just UI preferences, not sensitive
  - Safe to commit to Git, even public repos
- **Cross-device sync works seamlessly**:
  - Pull on Mac, Windows, Linux - same passphrase unwraps the same DEK
  - Each device decrypts `.md.enc` files using the unwrapped DEK
  - Settings sync automatically (stored in plaintext config)

**Security model (v2.0):**
- üîê Passphrase never stored, never logged
- üîë DEK wrapped with KEK (derived from passphrase via PBKDF2)
- üìù Notes encrypted with DEK using AES-256-GCM + AAD
- ‚öôÔ∏è Config plaintext (wrapped DEK + settings)
- üöÄ 10-100x faster than v1.0

See **[docs/ENCRYPTION_ARCHITECTURE.md](./docs/ENCRYPTION_ARCHITECTURE.md)** for complete technical details, security analysis, and threat model.

---

## üì¶ Building for Production

### Standard Web App

```bash
# Build optimized bundle
pnpm build

# Output in .next/ directory
# Deploy to any Node.js hosting
```

### Local Desktop App

Since this is local-first, the recommended deployment is:

```bash
# Build once
pnpm build

# Run locally
pnpm start

# Access at http://localhost:3000
# Install as PWA for best experience
```

### Portable Installation

You can package Holocron for sharing:

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/holocron.git

# Install and build
cd holocron
pnpm install
pnpm build

# Share the entire folder
# Recipients run: pnpm start
```

---

## ü§ù Contributing

Holocron welcomes contributions from Jedi and Sith alike!

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'feat: add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

Please follow the coding standards in `CLAUDE.md`.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### PWA Not Installing

**Problem**: Install button doesn't appear in browser

**Solutions**:
- **CRITICAL**: Run in production mode: `pnpm build && pnpm start`
- PWA is disabled in development mode (`pnpm dev`) by design
- Service worker only generated during `pnpm build`
- Use HTTPS or localhost (required for PWA)
- Try Chrome/Edge (best PWA support)
- Clear browser cache and rebuild: `rm -rf .next && pnpm build`

### Git Operations Failing

**Problem**: Can't commit or push changes

**Solutions**:
- Configure Git username/email in Settings
- Check remote repository credentials
- Ensure you have write access to the remote
- Verify your Git remote URL is correct

### Notes Not Saving

**Problem**: Changes aren't persisted

**Solutions**:
- Check repository path is writable
- Ensure disk space is available
- Check browser console for errors
- Try reinitializing the repository

### Build Errors

**Problem**: `pnpm build` fails

**Solutions**:
- Clear `.next` directory: `rm -rf .next`
- Reinstall dependencies: `pnpm install`
- Ensure Node.js 20+ is installed
- Check for TypeScript errors: `pnpm tsc --noEmit`
